# T-Text-Plus-Plus-Terminal-Based-Text-Editor
T-Text++ is a terminal-based text editor written in C++ for Unix-like operating systems (MacOS, Linux, etc.). It has many different features, and boasts a very user-friendly intuitive syntax/user interface, very reminiscent of the command-line Python and Lua, as well as the Pico-8 fantasy console.

## Features:

T-Text++ includes a few basic features:

- Reading a file
- Editing a file
- Deleting a file

Using the command `help` in the T-Text++ menu will display a list of possible actions.

It has a menu system quite reminiscent of the command-line Python (`python` or `python3`) and Lua (`lua`), as well as the PICO-8 and TIC-80 fantasy consoles.

## To Use:

Method 1: Use the command `cd "folder path"` to make the current directory the one with the `T-Text++` executable, then use the command `./program` to run T-Text++. 

Note: You can move the `T-Text++` executable to a different folder, in which `"folder path"` becomes. (I reccomend your home (MacOS: `/Users/user`, Linux: `/home/user`) folder since the terminal uses that directory by default, so you can skip the first step.)

Method 2: Double click on `T-Text++`. A new terminal window running T-Text++ should appear.
